    Ireland's no 1 charging point platform

    and update charge points for the benefit of the EV community. In addition to the charge point map,
    myecar-maps.ie provides supporting information on charging and electric vehicles to help current or
    prospective EV drivers to make more informed choices
    and enjoy their electric motoring experience.

<p style="color:black">CHARGING INFO RESOURCE</p>

<p>
    With so many new and technical terms relating to charge points, it can be a confusing topic; Myecar-map provides an overview
    of the different networks, overview of charging and how to go about getting a charging point for home or work.
</p>


<p>
    Making the decision to go electric requires some careful consideration; the electric vehicle section covers the different technologies,
    practical issues to think about, the tax and grant benefits available and provides a list of electric vehicles available to buy now.
</p>

<p>If a user finds a charge point which is not currently shown on Myecar-map, there is a facility to add details via the add a new charge point page.</p>
