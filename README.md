# Ecar-Charging-Project
Project Description:
We will be developing a GPS website that will make the users aware of all the E-Car Charging stations around Ireland. The user will be able to goto the site and see where the closest charging station is and whether it is being used or not and if it is in service or out of service. This website will be updated by the public for instance if a new E-Charging station has been installed nearby the user 
can update the site to make other people aware.
